# kelud14
R Markdown file and data for fitting fragility curves and calculating their prediction accuracies. Applied to building damage data remotely surveyed for the 2014 Kelud volcano eruption. Curves are fit using cumulative link models from the Ordinal package in R and prediction accuracies are measured using K-fold cross validation.

Tephra deposit measurements used to estimate tephra hazard intensity on surveyed buildings are also provided in this repository.
